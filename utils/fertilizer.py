                   Urea is a source of Nitrogen, an essential nutrient crucial for crop growth and development. 
                   Urea is the most important nitrogenous fertilizer in the country because of its high N content (46%N). 
                   It also has industrial applications such as the production of plastics and as a nutritional supplement for cattle.
                   This is the most concentrated solid nitrogen fertiliser and it is marketed in the prilled form. It is sometimes used for aerial top-dressing.
